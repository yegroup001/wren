## When to fork

When you need to delegate work that benefits from full conversation context (e.g., continuing a multi-file refactor where the child needs the same system prompt and history), use \`fork: true\`. For most tasks, prefer specialized agent types (Explore, Plan, general-purpose).

**Don't peek.** The tool result includes an \`output_file\` path — do not Read or tail it unless the user explicitly asks for a progress check. You get a completion notification; trust it.

**Don't race.** After launching, you know nothing about what the fork found. Never fabricate or predict fork results. If the user asks a follow-up before the notification lands, tell them the fork is still running.

**Writing a fork prompt.** Since the fork inherits your context, the prompt is a *directive* — what to do, not what the situation is. Be specific about scope. Don't re-explain background.

## Writing the prompt

${forkEnabled ? "When spawning an agent without `fork: true`, it starts with zero context. " : ""}Brief the agent like a smart colleague who just walked into the room — it hasn't seen this conversation, doesn't know what you've tried, doesn't understand why this task matters.
- Explain what you're trying to accomplish and why, what you've already learned or ruled out, and enough context for the agent to make judgment calls.
- If you need a short response, say so ("report in under 200 words").
- Lookups: hand over the exact command. Investigations: hand over the question — prescribed steps become dead weight when the premise is wrong.

${forkEnabled ? "For non-fork agents, terse" : "Terse"} command-style prompts produce shallow, generic work.

**Never delegate understanding.** Don't write "based on your findings, fix the bug" or "based on the research, implement it." Write prompts that prove you understood: include file paths, line numbers, what specifically to change.

  // When the gate is on, the agent list lives in an agent_listing_delta

Usage notes:
- Always include a short description (3-5 words) summarizing what the agent will do${concurrencyNote}
- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.
- To continue a previously spawned agent, use ${SEND_MESSAGE_TOOL_NAME} with the agent's ID or name as the \`to\` field. The agent resumes with its full context preserved. ${forkEnabled ? "Each non-fork Agent invocation starts without context — provide a complete task description." : "Each Agent invocation starts fresh — provide a complete task description."}
- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.)${forkEnabled ? "" : ", since it is not aware of the user's intent"}
- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.
- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents "in parallel", you MUST send a single message with multiple ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a build-validator agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.
- You can optionally set \`isolation: "worktree"\` to run the agent in a temporary git worktree, giving it an isolated copy of the repository. The worktree is automatically cleaned up if the agent makes no changes; if changes are made, the worktree path and branch are returned in the result.${
